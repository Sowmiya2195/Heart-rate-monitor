# Heart-rate-monitor
The Heart Rate Monitor measures a person's pulse using a sensor like the Pulse Sensor or photoplethysmography (PPG). The data is read by a microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32) and displayed on an LCD or sent to an IoT dashboard, allowing real-time monitoring of heart rate for healthÂ tracking.
